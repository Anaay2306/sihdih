# AI Symptom Checker Performance Improvements

## Recent Enhancements (Implemented)
✅ Jaccard index for better symptom similarity
✅ Combined scoring with weighted symptoms
✅ Confidence-based filtering and disclaimers
✅ Early exit optimizations
✅ Better threshold management
✅ Duplicate recommendation removal

## Performance Metrics
- Threshold lowered: 0.3 → 0.2 (more matches)
- Quality filter: < 0.25 similarity rejected
- Single symptom penalty: 40% confidence reduction
- Age bonus reduced: More conservative scoring

## Potential Future Enhancements
1. **Symptom Clustering**: Group related symptoms for better matching
2. **Machine Learning**: Train on historical data for better weights
3. **Temporal Analysis**: Consider symptom duration and progression
4. **Demographic Factors**: Include more patient characteristics
5. **Feedback Loop**: Learn from doctor confirmations/corrections

## Code Quality
- Clean separation of concerns
- Proper error handling
- Efficient algorithms
- User-friendly messaging
