### 3. **Improved Risk Assessment**
- **Enhanced Symptom Weights**: 70+ symptoms with precise medical urgency scores
- **Advanced Risk Categorization**: 
  - **Critical (0.9-1.0)**: Life-threatening emergencies
  - **High (0.7-0.89)**: Serious conditions requiring urgent care
  - **Medium (0.5-0.69)**: Moderate conditions needing medical attention
  - **Low (0.3-0.49)**: Mild conditions suitable for self-care
- **Age-based Risk Adjustment**: Considers vulnerable populations (elderly, children)
- **Multi-factor Risk Analysis**: Combines symptom severity, patient demographics, and case history

### 4. **Enhanced AI Response Format**
The AI now provides:
```json
{
  "risk_level": "high",
  "possible_conditions": ["Condition names"],
  "ai_cure": "Detailed self-care instructions",
  "doctor_solution": "Professional medical protocols",
  "recommendations": ["Step-by-step guidance"],
  "emergency_signs": ["Warning symptoms"],
  "complications": ["Potential serious outcomes"],
  "prevention": "Preventive measures",
  "duration": "Expected timeframe",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "emergency_required": true
}
```

### 5. **Improved Accuracy Features**
- **Jaccard Index**: Better symptom similarity calculation
- **Weighted Scoring**: Medical importance-based symptom evaluation

## üìä **Usage Examples**

### **Example 1: Chest Pain**
- **Input**: ["chest pain", "shortness of breath", "sweating"]
- **AI Response**: 
  - Risk Level: **CRITICAL**
  - AI Cure: "EMERGENCY: Call 108 immediately. Chew aspirin if not allergic..."
  - Doctor Solution: "Emergency PCI within 90 minutes, ECG, cardiac enzymes..."
  - Emergency Required: **TRUE**

### **Example 2: Common Cold**
- **Input**: ["cough", "runny nose", "mild headache"]
- **AI Response**:
  - Risk Level: **LOW**
  - AI Cure: "Rest 7-10 days, drink warm fluids, throat lozenges..."
  - Doctor Solution: "Symptomatic treatment, monitor for complications..."
  - Emergency Required: **FALSE**

## üöÄ **Performance Metrics**

- **Database Size**: 25+ comprehensive medical cases (4x increase)
- **Symptom Coverage**: 70+ weighted symptoms (3x increase)
- **Accuracy**: Multi-layered validation with confidence scoring
