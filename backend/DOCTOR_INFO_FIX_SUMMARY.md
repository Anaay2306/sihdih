# Doctor Information Fix Summary

## ðŸ©º **Issue Resolved: Patient Cases Missing Doctor Names and Treatment Information**

### **Root Cause:**
The AI symptom checker patient cases were missing traditional medical fields that users expect to see:
- `treatment` - Specific medical treatment prescribed
- `doctor_name` - Name of the attending physician
- `doctor_quote` - Professional medical opinion and explanation

### âœ… **Fixes Applied:**

#### **1. Added Missing Medical Fields**
Enhanced patient cases to include comprehensive doctor information:

```javascript
// Before (incomplete)
{
  "symptoms": ["fever", "cough", "headache"],
  "diagnosis": "Viral Fever",
  "ai_cure": "Rest for 5-7 days...",
  "doctor_solution": "Symptomatic treatment..."
}

// After (complete)
{
  "symptoms": ["fever", "cough", "headache"],
  "diagnosis": "Viral Fever",
  "treatment": "Paracetamol 500mg twice daily, plenty of fluids, rest for 5-7 days",
  "ai_cure": "Rest for 5-7 days...",
  "doctor_solution": "Symptomatic treatment...",
  "doctor_name": "Dr. Sharma",
  "doctor_quote": "This is a typical viral fever case. The combination of high fever with body ache and dry cough indicates viral infection. Rest and symptomatic treatment will help recovery in 5-7 days."
}
